______________

This github repository contains code and raw data to reproduce analysis and figures from our 2021 paper describing the mechanism of action of apopotlidin family glycomacrolides. The repository is organized by figure panel, with extended data figures prefixed with "ED." Some scripts and datasets were used to generate multiple panels across more than one figure and are named accordingly. All analyses were run using R version 4.0.4 on Windows 10 and additional information about package versions can be found in the Reporting summary that accompanies the manuscript. 

For deep mutational scanning experiments, this repository includes the variant frequency tables generated by GATK. Raw FastQ files for each sample can be found at GEO under accession code [GSE17136](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE171362). 

For questions or comments, please feel free to message me (Ben Reisman), email corresponding author (Brian Bachmann), or open an issue in this repository.
